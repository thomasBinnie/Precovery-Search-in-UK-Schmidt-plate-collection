# Precovery-Search-in-UK-Schmidt-plate-collection
This is a python program that takes the input of an object of interest and generates an ephemeris using NASA Horizons. This ephemeris is then used to find instances where the object of interest appears on UK Schmidt plates stored in the Royal Observatory Edinburgh plate library.
